# Pokemon-game-in-JAVA
Spring 2015
A project I demonstrated my professional experience in infrastructuring Java Spring framework for building simple application and microservices.
This is a mini game simulating the Pokemon games.

To play the game, simply run the PokemonStartup.java file and use arrow keys to move.
